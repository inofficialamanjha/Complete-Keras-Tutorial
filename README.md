# KERAS

Keras is a Neural Network API Written in Python and integrated with Tensorflow. In this repository i have covered on how to prepare and process data for artificial neural networks from scratch, build and train Convolutional Neural Networks ( CNN ), implement Fine-Tuning and Transfer Learning and Pre-processing Visual Data.
